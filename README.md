# bingus-casino
blackjack


How to play 
- cd <path>/bingus-casino
- g++ -std=c++11 -o blackjack blackjack_game.cpp
- ./blackjack

Some quirks:
- You see the dealer's hand in the beginning. 
- The dealer has a honed strategy to win. (Dealer just keeps hitting until he has 15 or greater)

Fun ideas if motivated: 
- Turn this into a LAN game
- Setup Venmo for stakes (figuring out OAuth in c++ sounds..fun)
   - Where does dealer money go in a 1v1? Charity of choice? Gambling laws?
